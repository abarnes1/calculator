This is a javascript calculator created as part othe The Odin Project. I based a lot of the display behavior on the built in Windows calculator, which turned out to be much more complex than anticipated.  

Overall, a lot of this was completed by thinking I had something right, finding out how wrong I was on some edge case, and having to write pseudo code to then translate to javascript to get it right. That's where a lot of if/else statements came from.  

Repeatedly pressing the = key added a lot of unanticipated complexity and is something that seems uncommon for this project.  I'm pleased that I could get it to work even if it took a major rewrite that blew up my original plan.

There's a lot going on to try and keep numbers both accurate and from spilling off the display.  Some math and string manipulation going on is probably handled easier by some currently unknown to me function but I'm proud of what I wrote to keep the display contained. 

All in all I'm **very** proud of the functionality of this calculator but think the code could be better organized now that I have a better understanding of what is required, both in general logically and via html/css/javascript.  It doesn't yet make sense with my current skillset to restructure an otherwise working and (seemingly) bug free application.
